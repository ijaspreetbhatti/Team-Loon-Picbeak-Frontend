# Picbeak Frontend Development

**Picbeak** is a data-driven web app built using React.js that allows children (and older
bird enthusiasts!) to learn about and identify birds in their region all while building their
'beakpedia' collection. This project is being created as part of the WMDD program at Langara College.
